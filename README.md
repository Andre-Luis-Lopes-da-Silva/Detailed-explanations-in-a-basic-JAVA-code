Just a brief study

#### 1. public class Main
public: This is an access modifier that makes the class accessible from anywhere, i.e., other classes in different packages can access this class.
class: In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects and contains methods and variables. The keyword class is used to define a class.
Main: This is the name of the class. In Java, the class name should match the file name if the class is declared public. So, if this is in a file, it should be named Main.java.

#### 2. public static void main(String[] args)
This line defines the main method, which is the entry point of any Java application. When you run a Java program, the main method is executed first. Let's break down each part:

public: This access modifier means that the main method can be called from anywhere, even outside the class.

static: This keyword means that the method belongs to the class itself, not to instances of the class. This allows the Java runtime to call this method without needing to create an object of the class.

void: This indicates that the method does not return any value.

main: This is the name of the method. It is a special method name that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for when running a program. It's the entry point for execution.

String[] args: This parameter represents an array of strings. When you run a Java program from the command line, you can pass arguments (input values), and these are stored in the args array. For example, if you run java Main arg1 arg2, then args[0] would be "arg1" and args[1] would be "arg2".

#### 3. System.out.println("Hello, World!");
This line outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

System: This is a built-in Java class that provides access to system-level utilities, including standard input, output, and error streams.

out: This is a static member of the System class and represents the standard output stream (usually the console). It's an instance of PrintStream that you can use to print text to the console.

println(): This method prints a string followed by a newline character to the console. The text to be printed is provided as an argument inside the parentheses. Here, the string "Hello, World!" is passed, so this message is printed to the console.

Flow of Execution:
The Java runtime environment starts by invoking the main method of the class Main.
Inside main, the statement System.out.println("Hello, World!"); is executed, which prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
The program terminates after the main method finishes its execution, as there are no other instructions to execute.
Summary:
Class Definition: Main class is defined, which contains the main method.
Main Method: This is the entry point of the program, which is called automatically when the program starts.
Output: The program prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
